"""Queue for a vast.ai GPU under a price ceiling and run a training command on it.

The instance is fire-and-forget: this launcher pushes the current git SHA, waits
for an offer that clears the hardware bar, rents it, and injects the SHA + the
(base64'd) training command. The box then clones that SHA, trains, and tears
*itself* down — destroy on success (checkpoints are already in R2, logs in W&B),
stop on failure (for inspection). See docker/on-start.sh.

    python scripts/launch_vast.py                         # search-only: print offers, rent nothing
    python scripts/launch_vast.py --dry-run -- uv run experiments/001_flow_matching_baseline.py
    python scripts/launch_vast.py --max-price 0.80 -- uv run experiments/001_flow_matching_baseline.py --cfg.max-steps 100000

Secrets (R2 + W&B) are NOT passed by this launcher — they live as vast *account*
env-vars (Console → Account → Environment Vars) and inject into the box out-of-band,
so they never land in the instance's extra_env. The launcher only verifies they're
present. The host needs no secrets, just a vast API key (~/.config/vastai). An
optional GITHUB_TOKEN is used solely to pull a private ghcr image (the repo is public).
