# vast.ai cloud lifecycle for a single training run. scripts/launch_vast.py reads
# this file and passes its contents inline as the instance's onstart command (NOT
# baked into the image — it runs before the repo is cloned, so baking would strand
# the box on a stale copy). The image ships only the environment (deps in
# /opt/venv), so this script lays the code in at the exact git SHA, runs one
# training command, and tears the box down — there is no persistent state on the
# instance: datasets are fetched from R2, checkpoints stream back to R2, and logs
# go to W&B during the run.
#
# Driven entirely by env injected at create time:
#   HAL_GIT_SHA          commit to check out
#   HAL_GIT_REMOTE       repo URL containing HAL_GIT_SHA
#   HAL_TRAIN_CMD_B64    base64 of the training command (base64 survives the env string)
#   AWS_*, WANDB_API_KEY  R2 + W&B credentials
#   GITHUB_TOKEN         optional; only set when the repo/image is private
#   HAL_KEEP_ALIVE       optional; "1" disables all self-teardown (debug: leave box up)
# vast injects CONTAINER_ID + CONTAINER_API_KEY (a per-instance key) so the box
# can stop/destroy itself.

#     don't leak into `show instance`/extra_env.
#   - the per-run `-e` vars (HAL_GIT_SHA, HAL_TRAIN_CMD_B64, HAL_KEEP_ALIVE) — these
