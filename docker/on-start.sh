# The image ships only the environment (deps in /opt/venv), so this script lays
# the code in at the exact git SHA, runs one training command, and tears the box
# down — there is no persistent state on the instance: datasets are fetched from
# R2, checkpoints stream back to R2, and logs go to W&B during the run.

#   HAL_GIT_SHA          commit to check out
#   HAL_TRAIN_CMD_B64    base64 of the training command (base64 survives the env string)
#   AWS_*, WANDB_API_KEY  R2 + W&B credentials
#   GITHUB_TOKEN         optional; only set when the repo/image is private
# vast injects CONTAINER_ID + CONTAINER_API_KEY (a per-instance key) so the box
# can stop/destroy itself.
