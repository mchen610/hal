# HAL

Training superhuman AI for *Super Smash Bros. Melee* via imitation learning and RL.

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ericyuegu/hal.git
cd hal
uv sync                              # builds peppi-py from source — see Appendix if you don't have Rust
cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env # fill in AWS_* creds — ask Eric
source .env                          # or use direnv

# download emulator & datasets
uv run fetch                         # download ~2 GB into <repo>/fixtures/
uv run pytest tests/                 # expect: 39 passed
```

After fetch, `fixtures/` looks like:

```
fixtures/
  dev.7z                        # 37 MB — slp archive
  dev/mds/                      # train/, val/, test/, manifest.jsonl, stats.json
  ssbm.ciso
  dolphin/exiai/squashfs-root/  # headless Dolphin
```

`fetch` is idempotent (logs `skip <name> (sha match)`). Fetch a single fixture with `fetch --name {dev.7z | dev-mds | ssbm.ciso | dolphin-exiai}`. Override path defaults via `HAL_*` env vars — see `hal/paths.py`.

The strongest end-to-end check is a closed-loop bit-exact round-trip through Dolphin:

```bash
uv run python -m hal.scripts.roundtrip --max-frames 200
# expect: PASS (bit-exact across 11 post-fields × 2 ports)
```

## Data pipeline

Three stages in `hal/scripts/` turn `.slp` files (loose or `.7z`-archived) into MDS shards:

1. **`index`** — walk replays; write `index.jsonl` (one row of metadata per file).
2. **`filter`** — query `index.jsonl`; emit `paths.txt` of replays to keep.
3. **`materialize`** — read `paths.txt` + `index.jsonl`; write MDS shards + `manifest.jsonl` + `stats.json`.

`paths.txt` lines are either filesystem paths or `archive://<abs-archive>!<member>` synthetic paths; one file may mix both, and the materialize stage streams archive members from a bounded tmpfs ring (`/dev/shm/...`) without ever extracting to disk.

```bash
# Stage 1 — index a .7z archive (no extraction; tmpfs-backed)
uv run python -m hal.scripts.index \
    --archive fixtures/dev.7z --output /tmp/index.jsonl

# Stage 2 — filter to a paths.txt (defaults: completed games, ≥1500 frames, six tournament stages)
uv run python -m hal.scripts.filter \
    --index /tmp/index.jsonl --output /tmp/paths.txt

# Stage 3 — paths.txt + index.jsonl → MDS shards
uv run python -m hal.scripts.materialize \
    --paths-file /tmp/paths.txt --index /tmp/index.jsonl --output /tmp/mds
```

Fold additional archives into one `index.jsonl` with `--incremental` on Stage 1.

## Closed-loop round-trip

The driver in `hal/sim/` plays an MDS row back through Dolphin and diffs against the original `.slp`:

```bash
uv run python -m hal.scripts.roundtrip --max-frames 200
```

Defaults read from `fixtures/`; override via flags. Training and evaluation drivers are being rewritten on top of `hal/sim/` and the new MDS schema; nothing here ships yet.

## Adding a new fixture (maintainer)

The fixture registry is `hal/fixtures.py`. Two backends:

**R2 (private artifacts: replays, derived bundles, ISO):**

```bash
rclone copy -P --stats-one-line <local-path> r2:hal/fixtures/<key>
sha256sum <local-path>
```

Then add a `Fixture(...)` entry with `r2_key="fixtures/<key>"`, the sha256, and a `dest=Path(...)` under `fixtures/`. If the artifact is a directory tree, tar it with `tar --use-compress-program='zstd -19 -T0'` and set `extract="tar_zst"` (the tarball must contain its files at the root, not under a wrapper dir).

**Upstream URLs (public binaries from GitHub Releases / CDNs):**

```bash
curl -sL <url> | sha256sum
```

Then add a `Fixture(..., url="<pinned-tag-url>", sha256=..., extract=...)` entry. Don't re-host upstream binaries to R2 — pin the tag and verify by sha256. If the release is ever yanked, mirror to R2 then.

After editing `hal/fixtures.py`, the new fixture is included in `fetch` and selectable via `--name`. Sha mismatch is a hard error — `ensure()` fails loud.

## Appendix: prerequisites

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04+. Linux is highly recommended — macOS works with one extra dep; Windows is dodgy.

### uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Rust toolchain

`peppi-py` is pulled from a fork and compiled via `maturin` during `uv sync` (one-time, ~35s; cached after). Only required if you're going to parse `.slp` files locally — i.e. run `hal.scripts.{index,filter,materialize}`, `roundtrip`, or anything that imports `hal.data.extract`. The plain `fetch` step doesn't touch peppi-py at runtime, but `uv sync` still tries to compile it, so install Rust once if you don't have it:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain stable --profile minimal
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### macOS

`libmelee` needs a system `enet`:

```bash
brew install enet
CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix enet)/include" LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix enet)/lib -lenet" uv sync
```
