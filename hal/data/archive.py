"""Stream .slp members directly out of a public-dump replay archive into /dev/shm.

The dump ships in two mutually-incompatible on-disk layouts and both must work:

1. **Solid 7z of raw ``.slp``** — ``dev.7z`` and ranked-anonymized chunks 1-2.
   ~10x compressed (LZMA2), >100 GB per chunk. Decompression is folder-parallel
   under py7zr; we drive it via a custom ``WriterFactory`` so members stream
   to per-file tmpfs writers, with two non-obvious py7zr workarounds:

   a. py7zr never calls ``close()`` on the writer it receives from
      ``factory.create()`` — its internal ``MemIO`` wrapper has a no-op
      ``__exit__``. The signal "writer N is done" is implicit: it arrives
      when ``factory.create()`` is called for the *next* file in the same
      thread (folders extract files sequentially within a thread). We
      finalize the previous per-thread writer at that point, plus a sweep
      after extract returns to flush the last writer per thread.

   b. Backpressure has to happen *before* a tmpfs file is opened, not after,
      or a slow consumer lets the producer fill /dev/shm. The factory
      acquires a bounded semaphore *before* constructing each per-file
      writer, and the consumer releases the slot after it's done with the
      path.

2. **ZIP-of-``.slp.gz``** — ranked-anonymized chunks 3+ (despite the ``.7z``
   extension upstream chose). Per-file gzip inside a zip aggregator container;
   ~25% less dense than solid 7z but trivially random-access. We stream one
   member at a time via stdlib ``zipfile`` + ``gzip``, no producer thread —
   the consumer's hold on the generator is sufficient backpressure.

``iter_archive_members`` sniffs by magic bytes (extension is unreliable) and
dispatches. Both paths yield ``(synthetic_path, tmpfs_path)`` with the same
ownership contract; the materialized tmpfs file is always raw ``.slp``
regardless of source — the ``.gz`` layer is stripped on the zip path.

    """Yield ``(synthetic_path, tmpfs_path)`` for each slp member of ``archive``.

    Dispatches by magic bytes: solid 7z chunks go through the threaded
    py7zr producer (``_iter_7z_members``), zip-of-gzipped chunks through
    the stdlib serial reader (``_iter_zip_members``). The materialized
    tmpfs file is always raw ``.slp`` regardless of source — the ``.gz``
    layer is stripped on the zip path. Synthetic paths preserve the
    archive-internal member name (so zip members appear as ``.slp.gz`` in
    the synthetic path, matching ``list_archive_slps``).

    The tmpfs file is owned by the consumer once yielded: the consumer MUST
    unlink it (success or failure) so the producer can proceed.

    ``filter_paths`` is a set of *member* names — for 7z that's the
    ``.slp`` name as stored; for zip-of-gz that's the ``.slp.gz`` name.

    Iteration order: for 7z, "as files complete decompression" (roughly
    archive order interleaved across solid blocks — do not rely on strict
    order). For zip, archive order, member-by-member.

    Early consumer abort (``break``, ``GeneratorExit``, exception) drains
    the producer cleanly on both paths.
