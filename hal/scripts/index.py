"""Stage 1: walk a replay tree (or a .7z archive) and build `index.jsonl`.

One `ReplayIndexEntry` per .slp. By default a single peppi pass extracts
start/end/metadata AND per-replay aggregate stats (damage/stocks/inputs/SDs)
— see `hal.data.replay_stats`. Pass `--no-with-stats` for the metadata-only
fast path (~5-10x faster, no `entry.stats`).

Usage:
    # Loose .slp files on disk
    python -m hal.scripts.index --root /path/to/replays --output index.jsonl

    # .slp members streamed directly from a solid .7z archive (no extraction)
    python -m hal.scripts.index --archive /path/to/archive.7z --output index.jsonl

`--root` and `--archive` are mutually exclusive; exactly one is required.
Archive mode materializes each member to a tmpfs file (default `/dev/shm`)
just long enough for peppi-py to read it, then unlinks. Synthetic paths
(`archive://<abs-archive>!<member>`) are recorded in `entry.path`.

Incremental mode reads the existing `index.jsonl`, collects every path already
recorded, and only indexes new entries. Failed parses are logged and counted
but never halt the run.
