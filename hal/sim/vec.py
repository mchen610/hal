"""Drive N matches concurrently with a single batched policy call per frame.

``loop.drive`` runs one match, calling a per-port ``ControllerSource`` each
frame; the model forward is buried inside that callback, so it can't batch
across matches. ``drive_vec`` inverts that: it owns N Sessions, collects every
live model-driven port's gamestate into one observation map, and hands the
whole map to a single ``BatchPolicy`` call — letting the implementation run one
batched forward across all matches. The returned inputs are scattered back and
all Sessions step concurrently on a thread pool.

Why threads work: ``Session.step`` blocks inside ``console.step`` on a socket
recv (libmelee releases the GIL there), so per-Session worker threads overlap
and the emulators advance in parallel. The batched forward stays on the main
thread (single GPU, shared model state).

Torch-free, like the rest of ``hal/sim``: the model lives behind ``BatchPolicy``
in the experiment.
