    The window is anchored by its *chunk* position, drawn uniformly over the
    whole episode — including the opening frames. When the chunk sits near the
    start, the context runs off the front of the episode; those missing frames
    are zero-padded on the left and reported as ``ctx_pad`` so the model masks
    them from attention. This makes the episode's first frames real prediction
    targets (no skipping), matching the closed-loop cold start where the rolling
    buffer fills from empty. Each emitted window carries an int ``ctx_pad``.

    This is a neutral obs→action-chunk window: it knows nothing about latency or
    real-time chunking. An RTC experiment that conditions on already-committed
    actions slices that prefix out of the chunk itself (its first frames).

    workers). ``replay_transform`` runs after schema validation and before
    window sampling. ``batch_transform`` runs after the normal TrainBatch is
    built. It receives the source windows and may return an experiment wrapper.
    Both callables run in loader workers, so they must be picklable when
    ``num_workers`` is positive.

    ``remote`` is the dataset's R2 root URI; when set, StreamingDataset pulls the
    split's shards on demand into the ``data_root`` cache (cloud training). When
    None, ``data_root`` must already hold the shards (local dev/overfit).

    ``cache_limit`` bounds that local shard cache (e.g. ``"100gb"``) so a dataset
    far larger than disk streams without filling it — StreamingDataset evicts
    least-recently-used shards past the limit. Only meaningful with ``remote`` set:
    a local-only dataset has nowhere to re-download an evicted shard from, so it's
    ignored when ``remote`` is None.

    ``shuffle_block_size`` is the py1e shuffle unit (samples mixed together). It
    governs *startup* download: py1e must buffer a block before yielding, so the
    default (``max(4e6 // num_canonical_nodes, 2**18)`` ≈ 4M samples) buffers the
    whole dataset when it has fewer samples than that — downloading everything
    before the first batch. Set it to a few shards' worth of samples to start fast;
    smaller trades global-shuffle quality for a lighter startup.

    A plain ``DataLoader`` rather than ``StreamingDataLoader``: the latter's
    mid-epoch resumption only engages when its dataset *is* a StreamingDataset,
    but here that dataset is wrapped by ``WindowDataset``, so the wrapper's only
    live behavior would be a per-batch ``len(batch[0])`` sample count — which a
    ``TrainBatch`` (not dict/Tensor) can't satisfy. StreamingDataset still owns
    sharding/shuffle; it's iterated inside the sampler."""
