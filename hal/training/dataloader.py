"""MDS dataloader primitives shared across experiments.

Lives outside the experiment file so that forked / forkserver-spawned
DataLoader workers can re-import ``WindowDataset`` and the collate path
without re-running experiment-level module code. Keeping this file
side-effect-free is what makes that work — and is also why the per-feature
``preprocess`` runs here in the worker (emitting a ready-to-use ``TrainBatch``)

    This is a neutral obs→action-chunk window: it knows nothing about latency or

    ``remote`` is the dataset's R2 root URI; when set, StreamingDataset pulls the
    split's shards on demand into the ``data_root`` cache (cloud training). When
    None, ``data_root`` must already hold the shards (local dev/overfit).

    ``cache_limit`` bounds that local shard cache (e.g. ``"100gb"``) so a dataset
    far larger than disk streams without filling it — StreamingDataset evicts
    least-recently-used shards past the limit. Only meaningful with ``remote`` set:
    a local-only dataset has nowhere to re-download an evicted shard from, so it's
    ignored when ``remote`` is None.

    ``shuffle_block_size`` is the py1e shuffle unit (samples mixed together). It
    governs *startup* download: py1e must buffer a block before yielding, so the
    default (``max(4e6 // num_canonical_nodes, 2**18)`` ≈ 4M samples) buffers the
    whole dataset when it has fewer samples than that — downloading everything
    before the first batch. Set it to a few shards' worth of samples to start fast;
    smaller trades global-shuffle quality for a lighter startup.

    A plain ``DataLoader`` rather than ``StreamingDataLoader``: the latter's
    mid-epoch resumption only engages when its dataset *is* a StreamingDataset,
    but here that dataset is wrapped by ``WindowDataset``, so the wrapper's only
    live behavior would be a per-batch ``len(batch[0])`` sample count — which a
    ``TrainBatch`` (not dict/Tensor) can't satisfy. StreamingDataset still owns

    # GPU stalled on every shard miss. Set it explicitly for the *remote* path. For a
