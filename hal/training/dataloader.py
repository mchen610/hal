"""MDS dataloader primitives shared across experiments.

Lives outside the experiment file so that forked / forkserver-spawned
DataLoader workers can re-import ``WindowSampler`` and the collate path
without re-running experiment-level module code. Keeping this file
side-effect-free is what makes that work — and is also why the per-feature
``preprocess`` runs here in the worker (emitting a ready-to-use ``TrainBatch``)
rather than on the training hot path.

    The window is anchored by its *chunk* position, drawn uniformly over the

    are zero-padded on the left and reported as ``ctx_pad`` so the model masks

    targets (no skipping), matching the closed-loop cold start where the rolling
    buffer fills from empty. Each emitted window carries an int ``ctx_pad``.

    This is a neutral obs→action-chunk window: it knows nothing about latency or
    real-time chunking. An RTC experiment that conditions on already-committed
    actions slices that prefix out of the chunk itself (its first frames).
