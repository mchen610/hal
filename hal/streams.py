"""Cloud-streamed training datasets.

Where `hal/fixtures.py` mirrors small dev artifacts to disk and verifies
sha256, `streams.py` names training-scale MDS datasets that are too big
to fully materialize. The MosaicML `streaming` library handles
download-on-demand: shards are pulled into `local` as the dataloader
reads them, and the cache can be evicted under pressure.

Usage:

    from streaming import StreamingDataset
    from hal.streams import RANKED_ANONYMIZED_1

    remote, local = RANKED_ANONYMIZED_1.for_split("train")
    ds = StreamingDataset(remote=remote, local=str(local), batch_size=...)

Credentials come from the same env vars as `hal/fixtures.py`:
`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. boto3 —
and therefore streaming — pick them up automatically; `s3://hal/...` URIs
resolve against R2's endpoint with no further configuration.

Cache layout mirrors the R2 prefix: `<repo>/data/<remote-key-path>/<split>/`,
already gitignored via `/data/`. Treat the cache as streaming-managed.
To pre-warm before going offline, iterate the dataset once end-to-end.
