"""Pin the slp-id ↔ libmelee-enum bridges in ``hal.wire``.

Two facts that ARCHITECTURE used to cite from a notebook now live here:

- Character ids do NOT identity-map. slp start-block ids are EXTERNAL/CSS ids
  (Fox=2, Falco=20); libmelee's ``Character`` enum is internal (Fox=1,
  Falco=22). Reading one as the other silently miscasts every character. All
  conversion goes through ``wire.slp_character_to_libmelee`` (external→enum)
  and ``wire.libmelee_character_to_slp`` (enum→external). Anchors below are
  verified against post-frame internal ids in real replays.
- Stage ids do NOT identity-map (slp 2 = Fountain of Dreams; libmelee
  ``Stage.FOUNTAIN_OF_DREAMS.value`` = 8). All stage conversion must go
  through ``wire.slp_stage_to_libmelee``.
