"""Pin the slp-id ↔ libmelee-enum bridges in ``hal.wire``.

Two facts that ARCHITECTURE used to cite from a notebook now live here:

- Character ids identity-map between slp and libmelee today. If a future
  libmelee update reorders the enum, this test fails loudly instead of
  silently miscasting characters at the controller-injection boundary.
- Stage ids do NOT identity-map (slp 2 = Fountain of Dreams; libmelee
  ``Stage.FOUNTAIN_OF_DREAMS.value`` = 8). All stage conversion must go
  through ``wire.slp_stage_to_libmelee``.
